      passage: `The Internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and access information. 
      Its origins can be traced back to the 1960s when the United States Department of Defense 
      developed ARPANET, a network designed to facilitate communication between research institutions. 
      
      In the 1980s, the development of TCP/IP protocols allowed different networks to connect, 
      forming what we now know as the Internet. The World Wide Web, created by Tim Berners-Lee 
      in 1989, made the Internet accessible to the general public through web browsers.
      
      Today, billions of people use the Internet daily for various purposes, from social networking 
      to online banking. The Internet of Things (IoT) is expanding its reach even further, 
      connecting everyday devices to the network.`,
